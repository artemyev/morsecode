This package is created and maintained by [LaravelUK](https://laraveluk.slack.com/). If you have any questions please feel free to contact us on our [Slack](https://laraveluk.slack.com/) space. 

We all know making new friends can be hard and especially if your a little bit shy (we have been there) it can be hard to approach people. We have a nice solution for that because you can find us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/UKLaravel) as well to hang out and read what we have to say there (You don't have to rush anything).
